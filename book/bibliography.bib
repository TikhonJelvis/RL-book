  abstract = {If options are correctly priced in the market, it
                 should not be possible to make sure profits by creating
                 portfolios of long and short positions in options and
                 their underlying stocks. Using this principle, a
                 theoretical valuation formula for options is derived.
                 Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as
                 combinations of options, the formula and the analysis
                 that led to it are also applicable to corporate
                 liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and
                 warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to
                 derive the discount that should be applied to a
                 corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

  abstract = {Options are important instruments in modern finance. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) methods---in particular, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI)---for the problem of learning exercise policies for American options. We develop finite-time bounds on the performance of the policy obtained with LSPI and compare LSPI and the fitted Q-iteration algorithm (FQI) with the Longstaff-Schwartz method (LSM), the standard least-squares Monte Carlo algorithm from the finance community. Our empirical results show that the exercise policies discovered by LSPI and FQI gain larger payoffs than those discovered by LSM, on both real and synthetic data. Furthermore, we find that for all methods the policies learned from real data generally gain similar payoffs to the policies learned from simulated data. Our work shows that solution methods developed in machine learning can advance the state-of-the-art in an important and challenging application area, while demonstrating that computational finance remains a promising area for future applications of machine learning methods.},

policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement
learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant
of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function
estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from
the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or

of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.},

  abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‚Äòvalue networks‚Äô to evaluate board positions and ‚Äòpolicy networks‚Äô to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

As opposed to previous theoretical work, we consider the case when the training data consists of a single sample path (trajectory) of some behaviour policy.In particular, we do not assume access to a generative model of the environment.The algorithm studied is fitted Q-iteration where in successive iterations the $Q$-functions of the intermediate policies are obtained by means of minimizing a novel Bellman-residual type error.PAC-style polynomial bounds are derived on the number of samples needed to guarantee near-optimal performance where the bound depends on the mixing rate of the trajectory, the smoothness properties of the underlying Markovian Decision Problem, the approximation power and capacity of the function set used.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

@preprint{buhler2018hedging,
  abstract = {We present a framework for hedging a portfolio of derivatives in the presence
of market frictions such as transaction costs, market impact, liquidity
constraints or risk limits using modern deep reinforcement machine learning
methods.
  We discuss how standard reinforcement learning methods can be applied to
non-linear reward structures, i.e. in our case convex risk measures. As a
general contribution to the use of deep learning for stochastic processes, we
also show that the set of constrained trading strategies used by our algorithm
is large enough to $\epsilon$-approximate any optimal solution.
  Our algorithm can be implemented efficiently even in high-dimensional
situations using modern machine learning tools. Its structure does not depend
on specific market dynamics, and generalizes across hedging instruments
including the use of liquid derivatives. Its computational performance is
largely invariant in the size of the portfolio as it depends mainly on the
number of hedging instruments available.
  We illustrate our approach by showing the effect on hedging under transaction
costs in a synthetic market driven by the Heston model, where we outperform the
standard "complete market" solution.},

We consider an i.i.d. policy-evaluation setting in which the data need not come from on-policy experience. The gradient temporal-difference (GTD) algorithm estimates the expected update vector of the TD(0) algorithm and performs stochastic gradient descent on its L2 norm. We prove that this algorithm is stable and convergent under the usual stochastic approximation conditions to the same least-squares solution as found by the LSTD, but without LSTD's quadratic computational complexity. GTD is online and incremental, and does not involve multiplying by products of likelihood ratios as in importance-sampling methods.},

  abstract = {Sutton, Szepesvari and Maei (2009) recently introduced the first temporal-difference learning algorithm compatible with both linear function approximation and off-policy training, and whose complexity scales only linearly in the size of the function approximator. Although their gradient temporal difference (GTD) algorithm converges reliably, it can be very slow compared to conventional linear TD (on on-policy problems where TD is convergent), calling into question its practical utility. In this paper we introduce two new related algorithms with better convergence rates. The first algorithm, GTD2, is derived and proved convergent just as GTD was, but uses a different objective function and converges significantly faster (but still not as fast as conventional TD). The second new algorithm, linear TD with gradient correction, or TDC, uses the same update rule as conventional TD except for an additional term which is initially zero. In our experiments on small test problems and in a Computer Go application with a million features, the learning rate of this algorithm was comparable to that of conventional TD. This algorithm appears to extend linear TD to off-policy learning with no penalty in performance while only doubling computational requirements.},
