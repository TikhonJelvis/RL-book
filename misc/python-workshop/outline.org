* General Idea
  1. introduce Python features to build up a little framework
  2. intersperse exercises to *use* and *extend* the framework

** Concepts
Split concepts into two categories:
  - abstracting over *data*
  - abstracting over *computation*

Depending on timing, this might work well for day 1 vs day 2.

* Outline

** What's the point of abstracting?
     - closer mapping between how you *think* about a domain and your code
       - easier debugging
       - useful tool for design + problem-solving
         - example: case analysis to catch edge-cases/combinations you
           might otherwise miss
     - more flexible/extensible code
       - cover different sorts of behavior with the same code (eg
         tabular vs sampling distributions)
       - this is useful even for short-term, "one-off" work
         - if it's easy to reuse your code, it's easy to add a new
           benchmark/experiment right before a deadline :)
     - TODO: more up-front explanation or add more examples/details
       throught the rest of the topics

*** How are we going to cover this?
     - Python has a number of features that support this approach to programming
     - we'll demonstrate the features, building up a simple framework
       for DP + RL
       - not meant for "production" use...
       - ...but flexible enough to be extended into "real" frameworks

** Abstracting over Computation
*** Why?
    - we've talked about different types of data, but what about
      behavior/algorithms/etc?
    - example: iterative algorithms, dynamic programming
    - probably start introducing basic MDP + dynamic programming
      framework here?
      - seems like there are fewer topics for Day 2, so we could spend
        more time on programming + exercises, bringing all the ideas
        together

*** First-class Functions
    - functions are values
    - example: policies

*** Iterators and generators
    - how do we represent iterative algorithms + convergence?
    - example: compare dynamic programming with and without iterators
      - useful example: show how we'd need to copy/paste lots of code
        if we couldn't separate the stopping criterion from the base
        DP/RL algorithm
    - mention ADAM/SGD/etc
      - see function approximation from RL book

**** Exercises
    - implement simple iterative algorithms
    - maybe try real DP/RL algorithms too?
    - see [[https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/squint.pdf][power series examples]]
    - see [[https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-24.html#%_sec_3.5][streams in SICP]]

** Abstracting over Data

*** Classes + Dataclasses
    - simple example of classes
      - mostly for probability distributions?
    - how dataclasses make this simpler
    - cover immutability?
      - not sure we want to emphasize this too much because it's hard
        to explain /why it matters/ without more context—instead, we
        can just have examples in an functional style without harping
        on it too much

**** Exercises
     - we could have people implement additional types of probability
       distributions?
     - alternatively, have people write classes to represent something
       else?
     - another option: combine this exercise section with
       interitance/interfaces

*** Inheritance/interfaces
    - how can we captured shared structure between different
      types/concepts/etc?

**** Exercises
    - implement multiple classes that share an interface (eg different
      types of distributions)
    - write code that works for multiple types
      - either a standalone function or as methods on the base class
        (or both?)

*** Types
    - why are type hints and checking useful?
      - act as documentation
      - catch mistakes
        - need some good examples here
    - how can we demonstrate static typing in Colab?

**** Generics
    - use probability distributions to show why we need type variables

**** Exercises
    - make code written in previous steps fully typed?
